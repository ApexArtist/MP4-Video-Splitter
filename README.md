🐛 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
❌ "FFmpeg not found"
Solution: Install FFmpeg and ensure it's in your system PATH

bash

# Test FFmpeg installation
ffmpeg -version
❌ "Permission denied" errors
Solution: Run with administrator privileges or check folder permissions

❌ Video file not supported
Solution: Convert to MP4 first or use re-encoding mode

❌ "Out of disk space"
Solution: Free up storage space or choose different output folder

Performance Issues
🐌 Slow processing
Use Stream Copy mode for speed
Check available disk space
Close other applications
Use SSD storage for better performance
🔥 High CPU usage
Normal for re-encoding mode
Reduce quality settings
Process smaller clips
Ensure adequate cooling
Debug Mode
bash

# Run with verbose logging
python video_splitter.py --debug

# Check FFmpeg details
ffmpeg -version
ffprobe -version
